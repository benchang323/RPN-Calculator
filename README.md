# RPN Calculator
## Overview
This Java project implements a simple calculator that uses a stack data structure to evaluate expressions. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations and is designed to demonstrate the use of custom stack implementations in Java.

## Features
- Arithmetic expression evaluation using infix notation.
- Implementation of a stack data structure to manage operands and operators.
- Interface (`Stack.java`) defining essential stack operations.
- `LinkedStack.java` providing a linked list implementation of the stack interface.

## Files
- `Calc.java`: The main calculator class that uses a stack to evaluate expressions.
- `LinkedStack.java`: A linked list implementation of a stack used for storing data during calculation.
- `Stack.java`: An interface defining essential stack operations.

## Tech Stack
- Java

## Libraries/Dependencies
- Java Standard Edition

## Installation
```
